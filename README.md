## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data from Berlin to better understand:
1. How does cancellation policy influence utilization?
2. What factors heavily influence review scores?
3. How does the neighborhood influence the listing price? How well can we predict the price of a listing using a linear ML model?

The data source for Berlin 11-07-2019 was downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found in a medium blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@a.hampersberger/airbnb-berlin-first-steps-into-data-science-with-python-pandas-ba26026edf94?source=friends_link&sk=4e1a7e427a02d159e48fbe4a5b432ca2).
