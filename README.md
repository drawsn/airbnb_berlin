## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data from Berlin to better understand:
1. How does cancellation policy influence utilization?
2. What factors heavily influence review scores?
3. How does the neighbourhood influence the listing price? What factors heavily influence listing price?

The data source for Berlin 11-07-2019 was downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. The data source is also provided as a separate file.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
